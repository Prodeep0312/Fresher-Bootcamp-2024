USER STORY 

As a budget oriented shopping lover, I want a shopping dB app to help me:-

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1) keep a track of my monthly SHOPPING expenses 
2) find out the cheapest deals available across online platforms for a particular product.
3) input my purchases , categorize them and get notifications  for those products when they are available at the maximum discount possible . 

This way, the app’s main objective i.e., to save money is achieved. So, these are the functional requirements.

Talking about Non-Functional Requirements/ QUALITY ATTRIBUTE

1)PORTABILITY: Additionally, I want the app to be fully functional across different  MOBILE OS  like Android and IOS . This increases the app’s accessibility and usability across a wide range of devices.


2)ARCHIVING: Also the item details with lowest prices should be stored for a minimum of 10  years along with dates  for discovering past sales. Storing of data for a longer duration of time to efficiently compares the product prices.

3)SCALABILITY: The app should support 3000 concurrent users
